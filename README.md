## Loire

Loire is my first iteration on a Jekyll website. I started its development between December 2013 and January 2014, while I was in Nantes, France (hence the name Loire). Minor details were added over 2014.


## Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

Loire is built on Jekyll. Before getting started, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

### 2. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Loire applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/loire` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Then, open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser.
