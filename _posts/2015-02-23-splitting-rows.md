When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. In this world, everything can be happy. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Look around. Look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere you only have to look to see it.

### Just Watching

There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.

With practice comes confidence. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.

Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. The least little bit can do so much. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.
